### Investigating Global Emissions: A Data-Driven Approach to Resource Consumption and Climate Change Mitigation

The National Footprint Accounts dataset provides a detailed record of ecological resource use and biocapacity across nations from 1961 to 2013. 

By analyzing trends in resource consumption and emissions, this study explores the dynamics driving global emissions and identifies critical patterns for understanding humanity's environmental impact. 

Through data cleaning, segmentation, clustering, and time-series forecasting, this analysis offers evidence-based strategies to inform policymakers, researchers, and environmental advocates on how to effectively mitigate climate change. Key insights highlight the need for balanced resource management, the significance of biocapacity reserves and deficits, and the role of major contributors like China, the United States, and India in shaping future emissions trends.
