# INFO6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools

1. **Fibonacci, Primes, and Optimized Dictionary Search**: 
- Includes implementing iterative, recursive, and generator-based solutions for Fibonacci numbers, writing code to determine prime numbers (including a one-liner version), and developing a self-improving AI to detect prime numbers.
- Additionally, I worked on extracting time-specific sentences from Chinese and Hindi dictionaries and optimized the solution with concise Python code to achieve faster execution.

2. **Probability Distributions and F1 Racing Predictions**: 
- Calculates the probability distributions for F1 drivers to win the first three races (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia) using 2023 driver standings.
- It includes Red Bull’s chances of winning one or more races, weather impact on race outcomes, and predictions for Lewis Hamilton’s performance with Ferrari in 2024 based on historical data

3. **Storybook Creation with Python**: 
- In this assignment, I collaborated with a team to create a storybook in both English and a regional language.
- Using Python, we developed a program to stitch together 80-100 images into a 4-6 page PDF.
- The images were cartoonized with Python libraries, and text overlays were added.
- The assignment emphasized creativity and technical precision, requiring proper image resizing and seamless execution within a Jupyter notebook.

4. **Probability Modeling and Parameter Estimation**: 
- In this group assignment, we used a forest fires dataset to model a one-humped histogram with probability distribution functions (PDFs).
- We applied the Method of Moments (MOM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Bayesian simulation using PyMC3/PyMC to find the most likely parameters.
- We also compared the methods to determine which approach felt more natural and correct.

5. **Bayesian Estimation with Metropolis-Hastings**: 
- In this assignment, I used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the standard deviation of a dataset based on 1,000 observations from a population of 30,000.
- By leveraging Bayesian estimation and log-likelihood functions, the goal was to model the posterior distribution and simulate accurate predictions of the population parameters.
