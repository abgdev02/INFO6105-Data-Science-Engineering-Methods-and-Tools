# INFO6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools

This repository contains assignments and the final project for the course **INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools** taught by Dino (Constantin) Konstantopoulos at Northeastern University. The course covers foundational concepts in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python, emphasizing NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and Scikit-learn libraries.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple branches for ease of use:
- The `main` branch only contains this `README.md` file to provide an overview.
- The `assignments` branch contains all homework assignments completed during the course.
- The `final project` branch includes the final project submission.

You can switch to these branches to view the corresponding files.

## Assignments

The following assignments are completed and available in the `assignments` branch:

1. **Fibonacci, Primes, and Optimized Dictionary Search**: This assignment included implementing iterative, recursive, and generator-based solutions for Fibonacci numbers, writing code to determine prime numbers (including a one-liner version), and developing a self-improving AI to detect prime numbers. Additionally, I worked on extracting time-specific sentences from Chinese and Hindi dictionaries and optimized the solution with concise Python code to achieve faster execution.
2. **Probability Distributions and F1 Racing Predictions**: This assignment calculates the probability distributions for F1 drivers to win the first three races (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia) using 2023 driver standings. It includes Red Bull’s chances of winning one or more races, weather impact on race outcomes, and predictions for Lewis Hamilton’s performance with Ferrari in 2024 based on historical data
3. **Storybook Creation with Python**: In this assignment, I collaborated with a team to create a storybook in both English and a regional language. Using Python, we developed a program to stitch together 80-100 images into a 4-6 page PDF. The images were cartoonized with Python libraries, and text overlays were added. The assignment emphasized creativity and technical precision, requiring proper image resizing and seamless execution within a Jupyter notebook.
4. **Probability Modeling and Parameter Estimation**: In this group assignment, we used a forest fires dataset to model a one-humped histogram with probability distribution functions (PDFs). We applied the Method of Moments (MOM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Bayesian simulation using PyMC3/PyMC to find the most likely parameters. We also compared the methods to determine which approach felt more natural and correct.
5. **Bayesian Estimation with Metropolis-Hastings**: In this assignment, I used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the standard deviation of a dataset based on 1,000 observations from a population of 30,000. By leveraging Bayesian estimation and log-likelihood functions, the goal was to model the posterior distribution and simulate accurate predictions of the population parameters.

## Final Project

The project can be found in the `final-project` branch.

### Investigating Global Emissions: A Data-Driven Approach to Resource Consumption and Climate Change Mitigation
The National Footprint Accounts dataset provides a detailed record of ecological resource use and biocapacity across nations from 1961 to 2013. 
By analyzing trends in resource consumption and emissions, this study explores the dynamics driving global emissions and identifies critical patterns for understanding humanity's environmental impact. 
Through data cleaning, segmentation, clustering, and time-series forecasting, this analysis offers evidence-based strategies to inform policymakers, researchers, and environmental advocates on how to effectively mitigate climate change. Key insights highlight the need for balanced resource management, the significance of biocapacity reserves and deficits, and the role of major contributors like China, the United States, and India in shaping future emissions trends.
